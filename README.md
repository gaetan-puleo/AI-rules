# Architecture-Specific Rules for Spec-Driven Development

## 📘 Introduction

This repository defines a set of rules and practices for working with any AI-powered coding tool, such as:

- Aider.chat – A terminal-based, Git-integrated pair-programming assistant.
- Claude Code – Anthropic’s AI coding agent with deep project understanding and multi-file edits.
- Opencode – An open-source terminal UI coding agent that supports multiple LLMs and integrates with tools like Neovim.

These tools can all follow the same spec-driven workflow, with consistent prompting strategies and architecture-aware practices defined in this repository.
